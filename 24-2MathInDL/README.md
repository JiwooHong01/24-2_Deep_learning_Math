# Introduction to Mathematics in Deep Learning

Class Materials:
Covering Probatility, Information Theory, Linear Algebra, Optimization

I won’t be uploading the professor’s materials(due to potential copyright issues). Instead, I’ll reorganize what I’ve learned and upload my own handwritten notes.

- Definition of sample space/event/random variable
- Definition of Surprisal, Entropy(Entropy, Cross Entropy, Joint Entropy, Differential Entropy), Convexivity(Concavity), Mismatch, KL-Divergence
- Gaussian Distribution

Chapter 2. Estimation Theory
